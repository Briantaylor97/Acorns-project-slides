# TITLE
Acorns: A case sutdy and Outlook

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company

Acorns

* When was the company incorporated?

Acorns was officially founded in 2012.

* Who are the founders of the company?

The company was founded by a father and son team Walter Wemple Cruttenden III and Jeffrey James Cruttenden out of Irving, California.
The current CEO is Noah Kerner, who got involved 2 months after the 2014 launch of their first app.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

The idea for the company came about to promote passive and incremental investing using change from ordinary purchasing activities.  When registering with the Acorns app you tie in your debit and/or credit cards to a checking account, which rounds all transactions to the next dollar.
For example, a purchase at your local grocery store comes to $47.21.  Acorns rounds the purchase of $47.21 to $48.00, and will invest the rounded change of $.79.
The investment activities intitially included basic ideas such as checking and savings accounts but later expanded into stocks via ETF's, and Ira'S.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

Acorns initial first two rounds of funding amassed roughly $9 million.
In May 2015, just eight months after it launched, Acorns earned $23 million in its third round of funding, bringing its funding total to $32 million.
In April 2016, Acorns raised another $30 million in funding to expand its micro-investing products and services.
The latest round of funding in January 2019 brought in $105 million, which valued the firm at $860 million.  the investors in the latest rounf of E series funding include
Comcast Ventures, NBCUniversal, Bain Capital Ventures, BlackRock, TPG’s Rise Fund, DST and Michael Dell’s MSD Capital.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?  

The typical american household has $8,863 in an account at a bank or credit union, according to a recent report from Bankrate that analyzed inflation-adjusted data from the Federal Reserve.
That’s purely in liquid savings, so it doesn’t include retirement funds or other investments.  Among those 34 and younger, couples without children have the most put away: They have an average of $4,727 in savings. Single people without children in that age range have an average of $2,729 in savings.
However 58% of americans have less than $1000 in a savings account to cover expenses in case of an emergency.
Acorn is addressing the lack of financial stability and saving by providing an easy to use product which allows users to develop an investment and savings program from purchases tied to your banks debit card.
“We’re driven by the belief that anyone can grow wealth. Our report shows that Americans are taking small but important steps to save and invest,” says Acorns CEO, Noah Kerner.
“They’re motivated to take care of their financial futures, and it’s our purpose at Acorns to provide the tools, knowledge, and access to that make it possible.”

Below are the monthly service fees for they typical Acorn user (less than 1 million dollars).

Acorns Core, for $1, is the original service that rounds your purchases to the nearest dollar and invests the proceeds in your choice of portfolios. This version is free to college students.
Acorns Core + Acorns Later, for $2, adds access to a tax-deductible IRA plan.
Acorns Core + Acorns Later + Acorns Spend, for $3, is all of the above plus a branded checking account and debit card. Acorns promises zero fees on that account.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

The average age of an Acorn user is 32 years old, however they have users as old as 98.
Additionally the average income of their users is between $50,000 and $60,000.  This is not the typical income level for a traditional Wealth Advisor to target so offering services at an earlier age and income level allows the company 
to get clients earlier in their careers.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

Acorns initial domain in the financial industry would have been classified as Personal finance, Deposits, and online Banking.  However since its inception, Acorn has offered many additional financial products to its customer base.  
With that being said, you could argue that Acorns could be considered a Wealth Management company.  

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

The Personal finance industry has experienced drastic changes in the past decade with innovations that allow users to actively participate in their investment decisions with greater flexibility.
Before these changes your average individual would track their investment activity or savings by relying on monthly paper reports typically sent by mail for update of where they stood.
Today, everyday novice investors can track changes in real-time with a few touches of a button or swipes.  The ease of use allows individuals to be more aware of their financial standing and market performance.
Companies are taking note, by expanding offerings to clients, providing information at lower cost or no cost.  In addition, fees charged by these providers has fallen as well.  There is a race to onboard new clients
providing the same exceptional service to create larger investment porfolios for the firm.


* What are the other major companies in this domain?

The two main competitors in this space are Betterment which has a $700 million valuation and Wealthfront whom has a $500 million valuation.
Another company that offers the similar coin rounding service is Stash.  Stash allows its users to pick specific stocks to invest in rather than the 6 ETF's 
in the Acorn portfolio.


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

Acorns proves to provide small and novice investors with an simple method to save and invest money which is transparent for their customers.  Acorns has seen positive growth
in their customer base doubling in the past two years.  They have become a frequently talked about company for young individuals in college or early in their careers to take investing
and saving more seriously.  As reflected in their latest capital funding at the beginning of 2019, private investors are noticing as well the potential of this passive savings practice to becoming
the norm for future generations.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
Startup firms in the personal financial service space do not have traditional performance metrics like their more established counterparts whom have been providing similar investment services for many more years.
Thus, some of the metrics employed to measure interest in a non public company where it is more difficult to obtain financial performance is their web presence.
To define web presence, you need to look at website visits, a companys twitter presence, number of users, and growth percentage.
Acorns has roughly 2.3 million website visits per month of their current 4.5 million users.  This translates to a little more than half of their client base could potentially be visiting regularly.
The company's client base had doubled in the past two years, but has seen exceptional growth in their Twitter following.  As of July 2019, Acorns has nearly 61 thousand Twitter followers
and has and average like per tweet of 4.3.  Acorns growth percentage is slighty higher than its competitors Betterment and Stash at 1.76% dispite haveing considerably more employees.
* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!) 

Potential areas where Acorns may need to consider in their offering is a more robust array or diversity of investment options.  Acorns currently offers 6 ETF's, which is a diverse way more safely investing money/
However, as investors individualy become for savy and consider their investments more closely, they may want to become more active in where their money is investeed.
This doesn't always translate in better performance for the individual investor, but it provides peace of mind.  Some investors have personal conflicts with investing in companies whose products or services that do not align 
with their personal beliefs or ethics.  We often see this case in tobacco and pharmacutical industries.  Further enpowering the individual to invest in individual stocks can benefit some in their desire to "somewhat control their destiny".
Additional services to be considered in the demographic is partnering with loan service companies to assist their customers in first time home buying and student debt refinance options.
I feel with an established history of passively saving money along with an income stream from the individuals employer, these individuals would become more attractive candidates for these offerings
In addition to rolling out the additional services to these customers, the more developed offering would further attactract their customers to be a one stop shop for their financial needs as a young adult.


* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? 

The additional technologies employed in this endeavor would be more robust equity trading software being made to individuals who meet a higher capital threshold.
Credit reporting technologies could help inform customers of their credit score and prequalify candidates for different loan brackets using the investment as collateral
or as down payment.
